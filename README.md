## INFORMATION
**AUTHOR:** CHEN ZIQIAN <br>
**DATE:**   December 2017 <br>
**STU NO:** 140918481/jp2014212849
## INSTRUCTION
To run the programme,
1) Locate in the /code folder.
2) Execute 'init.m' to read all images into matrices. (Note: This could take some time)
3) Based on which exercise you want to look at, copy the corresponding paragraph well specified in 'ex_commands.m' and execute it. <br>
   Alternatively, you can simply run 'ex_commands.m' and all the results should be presented in order. 
4) Images will be written in the folder /results/jpg or /results/pgmppm. <br>
   Of course you can empty all the images in there before executing 3).
## NOTE
a) Due to the inconsistence of requirements between the instructions in the document and on QMplus, as well as the file size limitation on the submission page, I removed most of the generated pgm/pgm files and the docx report from my submission (they take up too much space). <br>
However, the compele set of my coursework can be found on [my personal Github page](https://github.com/Charrr/Course-ImageVideoProcessing-1718). *All rights reserved* <br>
b) Open any of these ppm/pgm files, there is a signature of my name embedded in the header (as required in the exercise).
<br>
c) In 'ex_commands.m' the statements for writing ppm/pgm files are commented, because they consume too much time. <br>
   You can un-comment them and execute if you wish.
