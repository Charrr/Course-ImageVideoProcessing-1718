## INSTRUCTION
To run the programme,
1) Locate in the /code folder.
2) Execute 'init.m' to read all images into matrices. (Note: This could take some time)
3) Based on which exercise you want to look at, copy the corresponding paragraph well specified in 'ex_commands.m' and execute it. <br>
   Alternatively, you can simply run 'ex_commands.m' and all the results should be presented in order. 
4) Images will be written in the folder /results/jpg or /results/pgmppm. <br>
   Of course you can empty all the images in there before executing 3).
## NOTE
a) All the results have been written in both jpg files (as required) and ppm/pgm files (as I thought was required) <br>
   To open any of these ppm/pgm files, there is a signature of my name embedded in the header.
<br>
b) In 'ex_commands.m' the statements for writing ppm/pgm files are commented, because they consume too much time. <br>
   You can un-comment them and execute if you wish.
<br>
c) All files have also been uploaded to [my personal Github page](https://github.com/Charrr/Course-ImageVideoProcessing-1718). <br>
