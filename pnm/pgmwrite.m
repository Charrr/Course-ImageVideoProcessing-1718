function pgmwrite(arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4,arg5)
%PGMWRITE Write a PGM (portable graymap) file to disk.
%
%   PGMWRITE(X,MAP,'FILENAME') writes a PGM file containing the indexed
%   image X and color map MAP to the file 'FILENAME'.
%
%   PGMWRITE(X,MAP,'FILENAME','ENCODING') where 'ENCODING' is either
%   'ascii' (or 'plain') or 'binary' (or 'raw') lets the user specify
%   whether the PGM file should be ascii or binary encoded. Default is
%   'ascii'.
%
%   PGMWRITE(I,'FILENAME') writes a PGM file containing the gray level
%   intensity image in the matrix I to the file 'FILENAME'.
%
%   PGMWRITE(I,'FILENAME','ENCODING') allows the user to specify the
%   encoding as described above.
%
%   PGMWRITE(X,MAP,'FILENAME',MAXVALUE) uses MAXVALUE as the maximum
%   gray value. This ables graymaps with more than 256 gray levels,
%   since the number of levels in the graymap is MAXVALUE+1.
%
%   PGMWRITE(X,MAP,'FILENAME',MAXVALUE,'ENCODING') lets the user specify
%   the output encoding as described above. Binary encoded graymaps can
%   not have MAXVALUE larger than 255, so a MAXVALUE larger than 255
%   will always give an ascii encoded file regardless of the specified
%   output encoding.
%
%   PGMWRITE(I,'FILENAME',MAXVALUE) and
%   PGMWRITE(I,'FILENAME',MAXVALUE,'ENCODING') works as described above,
%   but on a gray level intensity image.
%
%   The 'ascii' format is the most portable and is the only that allows
%   a MAXVALUE larger than 255, so it is also the most general. The
%   'binary' format files are, however, much smaller and many times
%   faster to read and write than the 'ascii' format.
%
%   If file name has no suffix, '.pgm' is used.
%
%   See also: PGMREAD, PBMREAD, PBMWRITE, PPMREAD, PPMWRITE.
