function [R,G,B] = ppmread(filename)
%PPMREAD  Read a PPM (portable pixmap) file from disk.
%
%   [R,G,B] = PPMREAD('FILENAME') reads the file 'FILENAME' and returns
%   the RGB image in the matrices R, G, and B.
%
%   [X,MAP] = PPMREAD('FILENAME') reads the file 'FILENAME' and returns
%   the indexed image X and associated color map MAP.
%
%   If file name has no suffix, '.ppm' is used.
%
%   PPMREAD can also read PGM and PBM images, but the output is always
%   returned as if the image read was a PPM image.
%
%   See also: PPMWRITE, PBMREAD, PBMWRITE, PGMREAD, PGMWRITE.
