function ppmwrite(arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4,arg5,arg6)
%PPMWRITE Write a PPM (portable pixmap) file to disk.
%
%   PPMWRITE(X,MAP,'FILENAME') writes a PPM file containing the indexed
%   image X and color map MAP to the file 'FILENAME'.
%
%   PPMWRITE(X,MAP,'FILENAME','ENCODING') where 'ENCODING' is either
%   'ascii' (or 'plain') or 'binary' (or 'raw') lets the user specify
%   whether the PPM file should be ascii or binary encoded. Default is
%   'ascii'.
%
%   PPMWRITE(R,G,B,'FILENAME') writes a PPM file containing the RGB
%   image in the matrices R,G,B to the file 'FILENAME'.
%
%   PPMWRITE(R,G,B,'FILENAME','ENCODING') allows the user to specify the
%   encoding as described above.
%
%   PPMWRITE(X,MAP,'FILENAME',MAXVALUE) uses MAXVALUE as the maximum
%   pixel value. This ables pixmaps with more than 256 values per color,
%   since the number of possible values is MAXVALUE+1.
%
%   PPMWRITE(X,MAP,'FILENAME',MAXVALUE,'ENCODING') lets the user specify
%   the output encoding as described above. Binary encoded pixmaps can
%   not have MAXVALUE larger than 255, so a MAXVALUE larger than 255
%   will always give an ascii encoded file regardless of the specified
%   output encoding.
%
%   PPMWRITE(R,G,B,'FILENAME',MAXVALUE) and
%   PPMWRITE(R,G,B,'FILENAME',MAXVALUE,'ENCODING') works as described
%   above, but on an RGB image.
%
%   The 'ascii' format is the most portable and is the only that allows
%   a MAXVALUE larger than 255, so it is also the most general. The
%   'binary' format files are, however, much smaller and many times
%   faster to read and write than the 'ascii' format.
%
%   If file name has no suffix, '.ppm' is used.
%
%   See also: PPMREAD, PBMREAD, PBMWRITE, PGMREAD, PGMWRITE.
