function [ int, count, msg ] = pnmgeti( fid, n )
%PNMGETI Get integers from an ascii encoded PBM/PGM/PPM file.
%
%   [ INT, COUNT, MSG ] = PNMGETI( FID, N ) tries to read N integers
%   from the ascii encoded PBM/PGM/PPM file with file identifier FID and
%   returns the integers in the vector INT. COUNT is an optional output
%   argument that returns the number of elements successfully read. MSG
%   is an optional output argument that returns an error message string
%   if an error occurred or an empty matrix if an error did not occur.
%
%   If N is omitted, the whole remaining of the file is read.
%
%   The main difference between PNMGETI( FID ) and FSCANF( FID, '%d' )
%   is that PNMGETI ignores comments (from # to end of line). PNMGETI
%   also ignores garbage, which is anything that is neither whitespace,
%   digit nor comment.
