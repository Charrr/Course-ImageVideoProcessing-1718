function [X,map] = pgmread(filename)
%PGMREAD  Read a PGM (portable graymap) file from disk.
%
%   I = PGMREAD('FILENAME') reads the file 'FILENAME' and returns the
%   intensity image I.
%
%   [X,MAP] = PGMREAD('FILENAME') reads the file 'FILENAME' and returns
%   the indexed image X and associated color map MAP.
%
%   If file name has no suffix, '.pgm' is used.
%
%   PGMREAD can also read PBM images, but the output is always returned
%   as if the image read was a PGM image.
%
%   See also: PGMWRITE, PBMREAD, PBMWRITE, PPMREAD, PPMWRITE.
